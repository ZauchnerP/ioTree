ioTree (now gmoTree) is an R package developed for importing, merging, and efficiently managing data obtained from running oTree (https://www.otree.org/) experiments. It's particularly valuable when dealing with complex experimental designs that span multiple sessions and generate a large number of files that need to be integrated.

ioTree is not an official package of the oTree team, but it was created to complement the open-source platform.
